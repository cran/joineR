# Description

The `joineR` package implements methods for analyzing data from longitudinal 
studies in which the response from each subject consists of a time-sequence of 
repeated measurements and a possibly censored time-to-event outcome. The 
modelling framework for the repeated measurements is the linear model with 
random effects and/or correlated error structure. The model for the 
time-to-event outcome is a Cox proportional hazards model with log-Gaussian 
frailty. Stochastic dependence is captured by allowing the Gaussian random 
effects of the linear model to be correlated with the frailty term of the Cox 
proportional hazards model.

# Unbalanced and balanced data formats

A typical protocol for a repeated measurement study specifies a set of 
information to be recorded on each subject immediately before or after 
randomization, and one or more outcome measures recorded at each of a set of 
pre-specified follow-up times. With a slight abuse of terminology, we refer to 
the initial information as a set of *baseline covariates*. These can include any
subject-specific time-constant information, for example measured or categorical 
characteristics of a subject, or their treatment allocation in a randomised 
trial.

A natural way to store the information on baseline covariates is as an $n$ by $p
+ 1$ array or data-frame, in which $n$ is the number of subjects, $p$ the number
of baseline covariates, and an additional column contains a unique subject 
identifier. It is then natural to store the follow-up measurements of each 
outcome variable as an $n$ by $m + 1$ data-frame where $m$ is the number of 
follow-up times and the additional column contains the subject-identifier with 
which we can link outcomes to baseline covariates. For completeness, we note 
that the follow-up times will often be unequally spaced, and should be stored as
a vector of length $m$ to avoid any ambiguity. This defines a *balanced* 
data-format, the term referring to the common set of information intended to be 
obtained from each subject.

In observational studies, and in designed studies with non-hospitalized human 
subjects, it is difficult or impossible to insist on a common set of follow-up 
times. In such cases, the usual way to store the data is as an array or 
data-frame with a separate row for each follow-up measurement and associated 
follow-up time on each subject, together with the subject identifier and any 
other covariate information, repeated redundantly over multiple follow-up times 
on the same subject. This defines the *unbalanced* data-format, so-called 
because it allows the number and timing of follow-up measurements to vary 
arbitrarily between patients.

In practice, the unbalanced *data-format* is also widely used to store data from
a balanced *study-design*, despite its in-built redundancy. Conversely, the 
balanced format can be used to store data from an unbalanced design, by defining
the time-vector to be the complete set of distinct  follow-up times and using 
`NA`'s to denote missing follow-up measurements. In practice, unless the data-set 
derives from a balanced design with no missing values, the choice between the 
two formats reflects a compromise between storing redundant information in the 
unbalanced format and generating a possibly large number of `NA`'s in the 
balanced format.


# Motivating Examples

The package includes four data-sets: `heart.valve`, `liver`, `mental`, and 
`epileptic`. Descriptions of each follow.

## The `heart.valve` data-set

This data-set is derived from a study of heart function after surgery to implant
a new heart valve, and is loaded (after installing the package) with the 
command:

```{r heart.valve_data}
library(joineR)
data(heart.valve)
```

The data refer to 256 patients and are stored in the *unbalanced* format, which 
is convenient here because measurement times were unique to each subject. The 
data are stored as a single `R` object, `heart.valve`, which is a data-frame of 
dimension `r nrow(heart.valve)` by `r ncol(heart.valve)`. The average number of 
repeated measurements per subject is therefore `r nrow(heart.valve)/length(unique(heart.valve$id))`. As with any unbalanced
data-set, values of time-constant variables are repeated over all rows that
refer to the same subject. The dimensionality of the dataset can be confirmed by
a call to the `dim()` function, whilst the names of the 25 variables can be
listed by a call to the `names()` function:

```{r heart.valve_dims}
dim(heart.valve)
names(heart.valve)
```
 
To extract the subject-specific values of one or more baseline covariates from a
data-set in the unbalanced format, we use the function `UniqueVariables`. The 
three arguments to this function are: the name of the data-frame; a vector of 
column names or numbers of the data-frame that identify the required baseline 
covariates; the column name or number of the data-frame that identifies the 
subject. For example, to select the baseline covariates `emergenc`, `age` and 
`sex` from the data-frame `heart.valve` and assign these to a new `R` object, we
use the command:

```{r heart.valve_covars}
heart.valve.cov <- UniqueVariables(
  heart.valve, 
  c("emergenc", "age", "sex"),
  id.col = "num")
```

The resulting data-frame `heart.valve.cov` has four columns, corresponding to
the subject identifier and the three extracted baseline covariates; hence for 
example:

```{r heart.valve_covars_samp}
heart.valve.cov[11:15, ]
```

To extract all of the baseline covariates, it is easier to identify the required
columns by number, hence:

```{r heart.valve_covars_unique}
heart.valve.cov <- UniqueVariables(
  heart.valve, 
  c(2, 3, 5, 6, 12:25), 
  id.col = "num")

dim(heart.valve.cov)
```

Notice that the dimension of `heart.valve.cov` is `r nrow(heart.valve.cov)` (the
number of subjects) by `r ncol(heart.valve.cov)` (one more than the number of
covariates). An analysis of these data is reported in Lim et al. (2008).

## The `liver` data

This data-set is taken from Andersen et al. (1993). It concerns the measurement
of liver function in cirrhosis patients treated either with standard or novel
therapy.

The data-set is included with the package as a single `R` object, which can be 
accessed as follows:

```{r liver_data}
data(liver)
dim(liver)
names(liver)
```

This data-set is stored in the balanced format. It contains longitudinal 
follow-up information on each subject, a solitary baseline covariate 
representing the respective therapy arm, and time-to-event information (time and
censoring indicator) for each subject.

Subsets of the data can be accessed in the usual way. For example,

```{r liver_sample}
liver[liver$id %in% 29:30, ]
```

shows that subject 29 provided only one measurement, at time $t = 0$, and was 
lost-to-follow up at time $t = 0.1013699$ years (`cens = 0`), whilst subject 30 
provided two measurements, at times $t = 0$ and $t = 0.09863014$ years, and died
at time $t = 0.1068493$ years (`cens = 1`).


# The `mental` data-set

This data-set relates to a study in which 150 patients suffering from chronic 
mental illness were randomised amongst three different drug treatments: placebo 
and two active drugs. A questionnaire instrument was used to assess each 
patient's mental state at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 post-randomization. The data
can be loaded with the command:

```{r mental_data}
data(mental)
```

Only sixty-eight of the 150 subjects provided a complete sequence of 
measurements at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The remainder left the study 
prematurely for a variety of reasons, some of which were thought to be related 
to their mental state. Hence, dropout is potentially informative. The data from 
the first five subjects  can be accessed in the usual way:

```{r mental_sample}
mental[1:5, ]
```

The data are stored in the balanced format, with 150 rows (one per subject) and
11 columns comprising a subject identifier, the measured values from the
questionnaire at each if the six scheduled follow-up times, the treatment
allocation, the number of non-missing  measured values, an imputed dropout time 
and a censoring indicator, coded as 1 for subjects who dropped out for reasons
thought to be related to their mental health state, and as 0 otherwise. Note the
distinction made here between potentially informative dropout and censoring, the
latter being assumed to be uninformative. Hence, the command

```{r mental_dropouts}
table(mental$cens[is.na(mental$Y.t8)])
```

shows that 21 of the 82 dropouts did so for reasons unrelated to their mental 
health.

## The `epileptic` data-set

This data-set is derived from the SANAD (Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs) 
study, described in Marson et al. (2007). SANAD was a randomised control trial to
compare standard (CBZ) and new (LTG) anti-epileptic drugs with respect to their 
effects on long-term clinical outcomes. The data are stored in the unbalanced 
format. The data for each subject consist of repeated measurements of calibrated
dose,  several baseline covariates and the time to withdrawal from the drug to 
which they were randomised. The first three rows, all of which relate to the 
same subject, can be accessed as follows:

```{r epileptic_data}
data(epileptic)
epileptic[1:3, ]
```


# Converting between balanced and unbalanced data-formats

Two functions are provided to convert objects from one format to the other. The 
following code demonstrates the conversion of the `mental} data-set from the 
balanced to the unbalanced format, including a mnemonic re-naming of the column 
that now contains all of the repeated measurements:

```{r mental_unbalanced}
mental.unbalanced <- to.unbalanced(mental, id.col = 1,
                                   times = c(0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8),
                                   Y.col = 2:7, other.col = 8:11)
names(mental.unbalanced)
names(mental.unbalanced)[3] <- "Y"
```

The following code converts the new object back to the balanced format:

```{r mental_balanced}
mental.balanced <- to.balanced(mental.unbalanced, id.col = 1,
                               time.col = 2,
                               Y.col = 3, other.col = 4:7)
dim(mental.balanced)
names(mental.balanced)
```

Note the automatic renaming of the repeated measures according to their 
measurement times, also that this function does not check whether storing the 
object in the balanced format is sensible. For example, conversion of the 
`epileptic` data to the balanced format leads to the creation of a large array, 
most of whose values are missing:

```{r epileptic_balanced}
epileptic.balanced <- to.balanced(epileptic,
                                  id.col = 1, time.col = 3,
                                  Y.col = 2, other.col = 4:12)
dim(epileptic.balanced)
sum(is.na(epileptic.balanced))
```

Once a data-set is in the balanced format (if it is unbalanced then
`to.balanced` can be applied) then the mean, variance and correlation matrix of 
the responses can be extracted using `summarybal`. An example is given below 
using the mental data-set:

```{r mental_summarybal}
summarybal(mental, Y.col = 2:7, times = c(0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8), 
           na.rm = TRUE)
```


# Creating a `jointdata` object

A `jointdata` object is a list consisting of up to three data-frames, which 
collectively contain repeated measurement data, time-to-event data and baseline 
covariate data. The repeated measurement data must be stored in the unbalanced 
format. The time-to-event and baseline covariate data must each be stored in the
balanced format, i.e. with one line per subject. Each data-frame must include a 
column containing the subject id, and all three subject id columns must match. 
The `UniqueVariables` function provides a convenient way to extract the 
time-to-event and base line covariate data from an unbalanced data-frame, as in 
the following example.
 
```{r liver_jm, cache=TRUE}
liver.long <- liver[, 1:3]
liver.surv <- UniqueVariables(liver, var.col = c("survival", "cens"), 
                              id.col = "id")
liver.baseline <- UniqueVariables(liver, var.col = 4,
                                  id.col = "id")

liver.jd <- jointdata(longitudinal = liver.long,
                      survival = liver.surv, 
                      baseline = liver.baseline,
                      id.col = "id",
                      time.col = "time")
```

As a second example,  we create a `jointdata` object from the single data-frame
`heart.valve` as follows:

```{r heart.valve_jd, cache=TRUE}
heart.surv <- UniqueVariables(heart.valve, var.col = c("fuyrs", "status"),
                              id.col = "num")
heart.long <- heart.valve[, c(1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)]
heart.jd <- jointdata(longitudinal = heart.long, 
                      survival = heart.surv,
                      id.col = "num",
                      time.col = "time")
```

A summary of a `jointdata` object can be obtained using the `summary` function.
For example:

```{r heart.valve_jd_summary}
summary(heart.jd)
```

A `jointdata` object can also be constructed from any specified subset of 
subjects. For example,

```{r heart.valve_subset}
take <- heart.jd$survival$num[heart.jd$survival$status == 0]
heart.jd.cens <- subset(heart.jd, take)
```

selects only those subjects whose survival status is zero, i.e. their event-time
is right-censored.

The `sample` function can also be used to select a random sample of subjects 
from a `jointdata` object, for example:

```{r heart.valve_sample}
set.seed(94561)
heart.jd.sample <- sample.jointdata(heart.jd, size = 10)
```

takes the data from a random sample of 10 out of the 150 subjects and assigns 
the result to a `jointdata` object named `heart.jd.sample`.


# Plotting a `jointdata` object

The default operation of the generic `plot` function applied to a `jointdata`
object is a plot of longitudinal profiles of the repeated measurements. If the
object contains more than one longitudinal variable, each is presented in a
separate panel. For example, the command `plot(heart.jd)` produces the following figure:

```{r heart.valve_jointplot, fig.width=7, fig.height=6.5}
plot(heart.jd)
```

A useful device for the joint exploratory analysis of longitudinal and 
time-to-event data is to compare longitudinal profiles amongst sub-sets of 
subjects selected according to their associated time-to-event, or specified 
ranges thereof, possibly in combination with other selection criteria such as 
treatment allocation or other baseline covariates. This can be done by applying 
the `plot` function to subsets of the data. For example, 
the figure below shows the longitudinal variable `gradient` in the 
heart data set as a pair of plots, with the two sub-sets of subjects chosen 
according to whether their time-to-event outcome was or was not censored. The 
figure is generated by the commands:

```{r heart.valve_plot_grad, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(heart.jd.cens, Y.col = 4, main = "gradient: censored")
take <- heart.jd$survival$num[heart.jd$survival$status == 1]
heart.jd.uncens <- subset(heart.jd, take)
plot(heart.jd.uncens, Y.col = 4, main = "gradient: failed")
``` 

Plots can be modified in the usual way by specifying graphical parameters
through the `par` function, or by adding `points` and/or `lines` to
an existing plot.

Another useful exploratory device is a plot that considers the longitudinal
trajectory of each subject prior to departure from the study, for whatever
reason, with the time-scale for each subject shifted so that their last observed
longitudinal measurement is taken as time zero. This can help to reveal patterns
of longitudinal measurements, e.g. an  atypically increasing or decreasing
trajectories, that may be related to drop-out.

The function `jointplot` produces a plot of this kind. As an example, we
consider the heart dataset, using the log of the left ventricular mass index as
the longitudinal variable of interest. The column containing the censoring
indicator in the survival component of the `jointdata` object must be
specified. The default for the `jointplot` function is to split the profiles
according to the censoring indicator.

```{r heart.valve_plot_lvmi, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5}
jointplot(heart.jd, 
          Y.col = "log.lvmi", Cens.col = "status", 
          lag = 5, 
          col1 = "black", col2 = "gray", ylab = "log(lvmi)")
```

Further arguments can be used to label and colour the plot to suit the user, as
well as options to add a (smoothed) mean profile.


# Exploring covariance structure

An important component of any joint model is the covariance structure of the
longitudinal measurements. For balanced longitudinal data, the simplest way to
explore the covariance structure is to fit a provisional model for the mean
response profiles by ordinary least squares and apply the `var` function to
the matrix of residuals. Note, however, that any mis-specification of the
assumed model for the mean response profiles will lead to biased estimates of
the residual covariance structure, hence at this stage over-fitting is
preferable to under-fitting. For example, in a randomised trial of two or more
treatments with a common set of follow-up times for all subjects, we would
recommend fitting a saturated treatments-by-times model for the mean response 
profiles, as in the following example.

```{r mental_resids}
y <- as.matrix(mental[, 2:7]) 
# converts mental from list format to numeric matrix format
means <- matrix(0, 3, 6)

for (trt in 1:3) {
   ysub <- y[mental$treat == trt, ]
   means[trt,] <- apply(ysub, 2, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
}

residuals <- matrix(0, 150, 6)

for (i in 1:150) {
   residuals[i,] <- y[i,] - means[mental$treat[i], ]
}

V <- cov(residuals, use = "pairwise")
R <- cor(residuals, use = "pairwise")
round(cbind(diag(V), R), 3)
```

Note that the variances show no strong relationship with time, and that the
correlations decrease with increasing distance from the diagonal.

For unbalanced longitudinal data, direct calculation of a covariance matrix is
unwieldy at best, and impossible if follow-up times are completely irregular. 
In these circumstances, an alternative exploratory device is the variogram. This
makes use of the theoretical result that
for any two random variables, $A$ and $B$ say, with common expectation,

$${\rm E}\left[\frac{1}{2}(A-B)^2\right] = {\rm Var}(A)+{\rm Var}(B) - 2 {\rm
Cov}(A,B).$$

In the present context, let $R_{ij}$ denote the residual associated
with the $j$th measurement on the $i$th subject, and $t_{ij}$ the corresponding
measurement time. If we are willing to assume that the $R_{ij}$ have a common 
variance $\sigma^2$ and that the correlation between any two residuals on the
same subject depends only on the time-separation between them, so that ${\rm
Corr}(R_{ij},R_{ik}) = \rho(u_{ijk})$, where $u_{ijk}=|t_{ij} - t_{ik}|$, it
follows that

$${\rm E}\left[\frac{1}{2}(R_{ij} - R_{ik})^2\right] = \sigma^2\{1 - \rho(u_{ijk})\}.$$

A scatterplot of the $u_{ijk}$ against $v_{ijk} = \frac{1}{2}(R_{ij} -
R_{ik})^2$ is called a *variogram cloud*, whilst a smoothed version,
obtained by averaging the $v_{ijk}$ within pre-specified intervals of $u_{ijk}$,
is called the *sample variogram*. The function `variogram` calculates
the variogram cloud. This function has an associated method for the `plot`
function that can display the variogram cloud, the sample variogram or both, as
required.

```{r mental_variogram, cache=TRUE}
vgm <- variogram(indv = mental.unbalanced[, 1], 
                 time = mental.unbalanced[, 2], 
                 Y = mental.unbalanced[, 3])
vgm$sigma2
```

The figure below shows the result of the following three calls to the
`plot` function. Note that whilst the default for plotting a variogram object is
to show both the cloud and the sample variogram, the sample variogram is almost 
always the more useful as a pointer to the underlying correlation structure of 
the data.

```{r mental_variogram_plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(vgm$svar[, 1], vgm$svar[, 2], 
     pch = 19, cex = 0.5, 
     xlab = "u", ylab = "V(u)")
plot(vgm, points = FALSE, ylim = c(0, 200)) 
plot(vgm)
```


# Model-fitting

The package includes functions for fitting two different classes of model using
maximum likelihood estimation. The first is an extended version of the random
effects model proposed by Wulfsohn and Tsiatis (1997). See Henderson et al.
(2000). The second is the transformation model described by Diggle et al. 
(2008).

## The random effects model

In the extended Wulfsohn and Tsiatis model, both the subject-specific mean 
response for the repeated measurements and the subject-specific hazard for the 
time-to-event outcome depend on latent random effect vectors. Hence, if 
$\lambda_i(t)$ denotes the hazard for subject $i$ and $Y_{ij}$ the $j$-th 
repeated measurement on subject $i$, the model specifies latent vectors $U_i$ 
and $V_i$ to follow  zero-mean multivariate normal distributions, realized 
independently for different subjects. Conditional on $U_i$ and $V_i$, the
repeated measurements sub-model is

$$Y_{ij} = x_{ij} \beta + a_{ij}^\top U_i + Z_{ij},$$

and the hazard sub-model is

$$\lambda_i(t) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(w_{ij} \alpha + b_{ij}^\top V_i).$$

In the above, the $x_{ij}$, $w_{ij}$, $a_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ are vectors of 
explanatory variables that may be time-constant or time-varying, and the 
$Z_{ij}$ are mutually independent, $Z_{ij} \sim {\rm N}(0, \tau^2)$. In 
principle, this is a very flexible model. In practice, the computational cost of
evaluating the likelihood restricts routine implementation of the model to 
low-dimensional $U_i$ and $V_i$. Wulfsohn and Tsiatis (1997) considered the 
special case in which the repeated measurements follow the so-called random 
intercept and slope model with $a_{ij}^\top  = (1, t_{ij})$, whilst the random 
effects for the repeated measurement and time-to-event sub-models are 
proportional, hence $b_{ij}^\top V_i = \phi a_{ij}^\top U_i$.

The function provided in the `joineR` package for fitting Wulfsohn-Tsiatis 
models is `joint`, which allows the user to choose from three models for the 
joint random effects: random intercept; random intercept and slope; quadratic 
random effects.

The first argument to `joint` is a `jointdata` object that provides the data to 
be analysed. The following two arguments specify the longitudinal and survival 
sub-models, making use of the regular `R formula` syntax, including 
incorporating a `Surv` object as the response in the survival sub-model for 
compatibility with the `R` function `coxph` from the `survival` package. The 
next argument `model()` allows the user to choose one of the three candidate 
random effects models, and defaults to the random intercept and slope case. 
Setting `model = "int"` and `model = "quad"` will fit a random intercept only 
and random quadratic joint model respectively.

The functions to fit a joint random effects model have options to fit the 
repeated measurement sub-model and the hazard sub-model separately.

The syntax for `joint` is best seen via examples. We will fit the joint random 
effect model to the `mental` data-set with the sub-models:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mbox{longitudinal sub-model:  } & Y_{ij} = X_{i1}^\top \beta_1 + U_{0i} + Z_{ij} \\
  \mbox{hazard sub-model:  } & h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp{\{ X_{i2}^\top \beta_2 + \gamma U_{0i} \}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

To do this, we first create a `jointdata` object for these data, using the unbalanced form of the data defined earlier.

```{r mental_jm1, cache=TRUE}
mental.long <- mental.unbalanced[, 1:3]
mental.surv <- UniqueVariables(mental.unbalanced, 
                               6:7, id.col = 1)
mental.baseline <- UniqueVariables(mental.unbalanced,
                                   4, id.col = 1)
mental.jd <- jointdata(mental.long, 
                       mental.surv,
                       mental.baseline,
                       id.col = "id", 
                       time.col = "time")
```

The following command then fits the model. Note that in the function call, the 
`Y ~ 1` and `Surv(surv.time, cens.ind) ~ treat` refer to the *names* of
columns in the relevant data-frames.

```{r mental_jm2, cache=TRUE}
model.jointrandom <- joint(mental.jd, Y ~ 1 + time + treat, 
                           Surv(surv.time, cens.ind) ~ treat,
                           model = "int")
names(model.jointrandom)
```

There is a `summary` method for a model fitted using `joint`. This produces a
summarized version of the model fit, omitting some of the information contained
within the fitted object itself.

```{r mental_jm_summary}
summary(model.jointrandom)
```

Supplying the additional argument `variance = FALSE` to the `summary()` command
results in the standard deviations rather than variances being displayed for the
random effect(s) and measurement error terms.

The function `jointSE` gives standard errors and confidence intervals for the
parameters that define the mean response profiles in a random effects joint 
model. The calculation of standard errors for the random effect parameters is 
not yet implemented. Approximate standard errors can be obtained by a parametric
bootstrap, i.e. by re-estimating the model parameters from simulated 
realizations of the fitted model.

The first two arguments to `jointSE` are the result of a call to `joint`, in
which the associated `jointdata` object is automatically stored as part of the
fit, and an option to specify the number of bootstrap samples taken. The
remaining arguments are included for completeness and mirror the last four
arguments of `joint` itself as well as a further option to control the level of
output printed to the `R` terminal. With a realistically large number of
bootstrap samples, this function can be slow! The output given is for 100
bootstrap samples, the confidence limits default to zero unless at least 100 
bootstrap samples are taken.

```{r mental_jm_boot, cache=TRUE}
model.jointrandom.se <- jointSE(model.jointrandom, n.boot = 100)
model.jointrandom.se
```

As mentioned previously, the argument `model` in the function `joint` can be 
altered to fit a joint random effects model with a random intercept and slope, 
i.e. the Wulfsohn-Tsiatis model, or a random quadratic for the repeated 
measurements sub-model. Choosing the former leads to the following specification
for the sub-models:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mbox{longitudinal sub-model:  } & Y_{ij} = X_{i1}^\top \beta_1 + U_{0i} + U_{1i}t_{ij} + Z_{ij} \\
  \mbox{hazard sub-model:  } & h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp{\{ X_{i2}^\top \beta_2 + \gamma\left(U_{0i} + U_{1i}t\right) \}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Similarly, setting `model = "quad"} leads to a joint random effects model of the
form:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mbox{longitudinal sub-model:  } & Y_{ij} = X_{i1}^\top \beta_1 + U_{0i} + U_{1i}t_{ij} + U_{2i}{t_{ij}}^2 + Z_{ij} \\
  \mbox{hazard sub-model:  }& h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp{\{ X_{i2}^\top \beta_2 + \gamma\left(U_{0i} + U_{1i}t + U_{2i}t^2\right) \}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The argument `sepassoc` can be set to `TRUE` for each of these model choices, 
allowing a different latent association parameter for each random effect in the 
survival sub-model, e.g. for the random intercept and slope model

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mbox{longitudinal sub-model:  } & Y_{ij} = X_{i1}^\top \beta_1 + U_{0i} + U_{1i}t_{ij} + Z_{ij} \\
  \mbox{hazard sub-model:  }& h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp{\{ X_{i2}^\top \beta_2 + \gamma_0 U_{0i} + \gamma_1 U_{1i}t \}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The default in `joineR` is that `sepassoc = FALSE`, in which case a model with
proportional association is used.

We now consider an example with separate association using the `liver` data will
now be considered. We first fit the Wulfsohn-Tsiatis model to the `liver` data.
The sub-models considered are those used in Henderson et al. (2002) to analyse these data.

```{r liver_jm1, eval=FALSE}
model.jointrandom.liver <- joint(
  liver.jd,
  prothrombin ~ treatment * time + I(time == 0) * treatment,
  Surv(survival, cens) ~ treatment,
  max.it = 1000)
```

A similar model, but allowing separate association, can be fitted by including
within the function call the argument `sepassoc = TRUE`.

```{r liver_jm2, eval=FALSE}
model.jointrandom.liver.sep <- joint(
  liver.jd,
  prothrombin ~ treatment * time + I(time == 0) * treatment,
  Surv(survival, cens) ~ treatment,
  sepassoc = TRUE)
```

The likelihoods for these models can now be compared using

```{r liver_jm_loglik, eval=FALSE}
model.jointrandom.liver.sep$loglik$jointlhood - model.jointrandom.liver$loglik$jointlhood
``` 

Allowing separate association increases the log-likelihood by 3.36 on one degree
of freedom. The parameter estimates for each of these models can be accessed via
the `summary` command as shown previously.

Our final example uses a subset of the original `heart.valve` data set that
considers only the response variable `grad` (gradient). The number of
subjects in this data set is reduced, because some patients only provided
measurements on `lvmi` (left ventricular mass index) and `ef` (ejection
fraction).
   
```{r heart.valve_jointdata, cache=TRUE}
heart.grad <- heart.valve[!is.na(heart.valve$grad), ]
heart.grad.long <- heart.grad[, c(1, 4, 7)]
heart.grad.surv <- UniqueVariables(heart.grad,
                                   var.col = c("fuyrs", "status"),
                                   id.col = "num")
heart.grad.base <- UniqueVariables(heart.grad, 
                                   var.col = 2:3,
                                   id.col = "num")
heart.grad.jd <- jointdata(longitudinal = heart.grad.long,
                           survival = heart.grad.surv,
                           baseline = heart.grad.base,
                           id.col = "num",
                           time.col = "time")
```

We then use the function `joint` with argument `model = "int"` to fit a random
intercept model to these data and summaries the result.
 
```{r heart.valve_jm, cache=TRUE}
model.jointrandom.heart <- joint(heart.grad.jd,
                                 grad ~ age + sex,
                                 Surv(fuyrs, status) ~ age + sex,
                                 model = "int")
summary(model.jointrandom.heart)
```
