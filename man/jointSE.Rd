\title{Standard errors via bootstrap for a joint model fit}
\usage{
jointSE(fitted, n.boot, gpt, lgpt, max.it, tol, print.detail = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitted}{a list containing as components the parameter estimates 
obtained by fitting a joint model along with the respective formulae for 
the longitudinal and survival sub-models and the model chosen, see 
\code{joint} for further details.}

\item{n.boot}{argument specifying the number of bootstrap samples to use in 
order to obtain the standard error estimates and confidence intervals. Note
that at least \code{n.boot = 100} is required in order for the function to 
return non-zero confidence intervals.}

\item{gpt}{the number of quadrature points across which the integration with
respect to the random effects will be performed. Defaults to \code{gpt = 3}
which produces stable estimates in most datasets.}

\item{lgpt}{the number of quadrature points which the log-likelihood is
evaluated over following a model fit. This defaults to \code{lgpt = 10},
though \code{lgpt = 3} is often sufficient.}

\item{max.it}{the maximum number of iterations of the EM algorithm that the
function will perform. Defaults to \code{max.it = 200}, though more
iterations may be necessary for large, complex data.}

\item{tol}{the tolerance level before convergence of the algorithm is deemed
to have occurred. Default value is \code{tol = 0.001}.}

\item{print.detail}{This argument determines the level of printing that is 
done during the bootstrapping. If \code{TRUE} then the parameter estimates 
from each bootstrap sample are output.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{data.frame}.
}
\description{
This function takes a model fit from a joint model and
  calculates standard errors, with optional confidence intervals, for the
  main longitudinal and survival covariates.
}
\details{
Standard errors and confidence intervals are obtained by repeated 
  fitting of the requisite joint model to bootstrap samples of the original 
  longitudinal and survival data. It is rare that more than 200 bootstrap 
  samples are needed for estimating a standard error. The number of bootstrap
  samples needed for accurate confidence intervals can be as large as 1000.
