\title{Creates an object of class \code{jointdata}}
\usage{
jointdata(longitudinal = NA, survival = NA, baseline = NA,
  id.col = "ID", time.col = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{longitudinal}{a data frame or matrix in the unbalanced format (one row 
per observation), with subject identification, time of measurements, and 
longitudinal measurements and/or time dependent covariates. This must be 
given if no \code{survival} argument is.}

\item{survival}{a data frame or matrix with survival data for all the 
subjects. This must be given if no \code{longitudinal} argument is.}

\item{baseline}{a data frame or matrix with baseline covariates, or non-time 
dependent covariates, for the same subjects as in \code{survival} and/or 
\code{longitudinal}. This has to be in the balanced format (one row per 
subject). By default an object of this class does not include baseline 
covariates.}

\item{id.col}{an element of class \code{character} with the name 
identification of subject. This is to identify the subject identification
in the data frames.}

\item{time.col}{an element of class \code{character} with the time 
measurements identification. This is to identify the time column in the
data frames.}
}
\value{
A list of length six. The first element is the vector of subjects
  identification. The second is, if exists a data frame of the longitudinal
  data. The third element of the list is, if exists a data frame of the
  survival data. The fourth element of the list is, if exists a data frame on
  the baseline covariates. The fifth is, if longitudinal data is given, the
  column name identification of longitudinal times. And the sixth and last
  element of the list is the column name identification of subjects.
}
\description{
This function creates an object of class \code{jointdata}. This
  is an object with information on at least one of, longitudinal data or
  survival data. Moreover, it can also have data on baseline covariates.
}
\details{
This function creates an object of class \code{jointdata}. This is a
  list with elements used in joint modelling, mainly longitudinal and/or
  survival data. The output has to have at least one of the data sets,
  longitudinal or survival. However, for joint modelling is necessary to have
  both data sets. Moreover, a third data frame is possible to be given as
  input, for the baseline (non-time dependent) covariates. The subject
  identification and time measurement column names are necessary.
