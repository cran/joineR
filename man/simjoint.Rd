\usage{
simjoint(n = 500, model = c("intslope", "int", "quad"), sepassoc = FALSE,
  ntms = 5, b1 = c(1, 1, 1, 1), b2 = c(1, 1), gamma = c(1, 0.1), sigu,

}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of subjects to simulate data for.}

\item{model}{a character string specifying the type of latent association.
This defaults to the intercept and slope version as seen in Wulfsohn and
Tsiatis (1997). For association via the random intercept only, choose
\code{model = "int"}, whereas for a quadratic association, use \code{model
= "quad"}. Computing times are commensurate with the type of association
structure chosen.}

\item{sepassoc}{logical value: if \code{TRUE} then the joint model is fitted
with separate association, see \code{Details}.}

\item{ntms}{the maximum number of (discrete) time points to simulate repeated
longitudinal measurements at.}

\item{b1}{a vector specifying the coefficients of the fixed effects in the
longitudinal sub-model. The order in each row is intercept, a continuous
covariate, covariate, a binary covariate, the measurement time.}

\item{b2}{a vector of \code{length = 2} specifying the coefficients for the
time-to-event baseline covariates, in the order of a continuous covariate
and a binary covariate.}

\item{gamma}{a vector of specifying the latent association parameter(s) for
the longitudinal outcome. It must be of length 1 if \code{sepassoc =
FALSE}.}

\item{sigu}{a positive-definite matrix specifying the variance-covariance
matrix. If \code{model = "int"}, the matrix has dimension \code{dim = c(1,
1)}; if \code{model = "intslope"}, the matrix has dimension \code{dim =
c(2, 2)}; else if \code{model = "quad"}, the matrix has dimension \code{dim
= c(3, 3)}. If \code{D = NULL} (default), an identity matrix is assumed.}

\item{vare}{a numeric value specifying the residual standard error.}

\item{theta0, theta1}{parameters controlling the failure rate. See Details.}

\item{censoring}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, includes an independent censoring
time.}

\item{censlam}{a scale (\eqn{>0}) parameter for an exponential distribution
used to simulate random censoring times for when \code{censoring = TRUE}.}

\item{truncation}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, adds a truncation time for a
maximum event time in the case of \code{model = "int"} or \code{model =
"intslope"}.}

\item{trunctime}{a truncation time for use when \code{truncation = TRUE}. For
\code{model = "quad"}, \code{trunctime} is required, and defaults to
\code{max(ntms)} if not specified.}

\item{gridstep}{the step-size for the grid used to simulate event times when
\code{model = "quad"}. Default is \code{gridstep = 0.01}. See Details.}
}
\value{
A list of 2 \code{data.frame}s: one recording the requisite
  longitudinal outcomes data, and one recording the time-to-event data.
}
\description{
This function simulates longitudinal and time-to-event data from
  a joint model.

\details{
The function \code{simjoint} simulates data from a joint model, 
  similar to that performed in Henderson et al. (2000). It works by first 
  simulating longitudinal data for all possible follow-up times using random 
  draws for the multivariate Gaussian random effects and residual error 
  terms. Data can be simulated assuming either random-intercepts only 
  (\code{model = "int"}) in each of the longitudinal sub-models; 
  random-intercepts and random-slopes (\code{model = "intslope"}); or 
  quadratic random effects structures (\code{model = "quad"}). The failure 
  times are simulated from proportional hazards time-to-event models, using 
  the following methodologies:

  \describe{

  \item{\code{model = "int"}}{The baseline hazard function is specified to be
  an exponential distribution with

  \deqn{\lambda_0(t) = \exp{\theta_0}.}

  Simulation is conditional on known time-independent effects, and the
  methodology of Bender et al. (2005) is used to simulate the failure time.}

  \item{\code{model = "intslope"}}{The baseline hazard function is specified
  to be a Gompertz distribution with

  \deqn{\lambda_0(t) = \exp{\theta_0 + \theta_1 t}.}

  In the usual representation of the Gompertz distribution, \eqn{\theta_1} is
  the shape parameter, and the scale parameter is equivalent to
  \eqn{\exp(\theta_0)}. Simulation is conditional on on a predictable
  (linear) time-varying process, and the methodology of Austin (2012) is used
  to simulate the failure time.}

  \item{\code{model="quad"}}{The baseline hazard function is specified as per
  \code{model="intslope"}. The integration technique used for the above two
  cases is complex in quadratic (and higher order) models, therefore we use a
  different approach. We note that hazard function can be written as

  \deqn{\lim_{dt \rightarrow 0} \lambda(t) dt = \lim_{dt \rightarrow 0}
  P[t \le T \le t + dt | T \ge t].}

  In the simulation routine the parameter \code{gridstep} acts as \eqn{dt} in
  that we choose a nominally small value, which multiplies the hazard and
  this scaled hazard is equivalent to the probability of having an event in
  the interval \eqn{(t, t + dt)}, or equivalently \eqn{(t, t +
  }\code{gridstep}\eqn{)}. A vector of possible times is set up for each
  individual, ranging from 0 to \code{trunctime} in increments of \eqn{dt} (or
  \code{gridstep}). The failure probability at each time is compared to an
  independent \eqn{U(0, 1)} draw, and if the probability does not exceed the
  random draw then the survival time is set as \code{trunctime}, otherwise it
  is the generated time from the vector of candidate times. The minimum of
  these candidate times (i.e. when we deem the event to have first happened)
  is taken as the survival time.}
