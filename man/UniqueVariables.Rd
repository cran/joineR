\title{Extracts the unique non-time dependent variables per patient, from an 
unbalanced data set}
\usage{
UniqueVariables(data, var.col, id.col = "ID")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame, or matrix, with at least a column of patient 
identification and a covariate column.}

\item{var.col}{vector of column names or column numbers, of the variables 
(non-time dependent). Cannot have mix of numbers and column names.}

\item{id.col}{column name or column number of the patient identification.}
}
\value{
A data frame with patient identification and covariates selected.
  Each row corresponds to the data for each individual. Note that, this can
  be only used for non-time dependent covariates. If extracting unique time
  dependent covariates, the function gives an error, because it can't select
  what is the unique covariate.
}
\description{
This function extracts a set of unique variables within a
  patient, returning a data frame with columns, patient identification and
  variables selected. Each row corresponds to the data for each individual.
}
\details{
This function can be used, when longitudinal data is in the
  unbalanced format, and it is necessary, for example, to extract the set of
  unique baseline covariates, or any non-time dependent variables, that in
  the unbalanced format, are repeated for each observation row. Also, if the 
  original data frame has survival data, this can also be used to extract the
  survival information from the original data set.

\examples{
data(heart.valve)
heart.cov <- UniqueVariables(heart.valve,
                             c(2, 3, 5, 6, 12:25),
                             id.col = "num")
