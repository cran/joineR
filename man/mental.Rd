\title{Mental health trial data}
\format{A balanced data set with respect to the times at which observations 
  recorded. The data consists of the following variables on each patient:
  
  \describe{
  
  \item{\code{id}}{integer: patient identifier.}
  
  \item{\code{Y.t0}}{integer: mental state assessment in week 0. Coded
  \code{NA} if missing.}
  
  \item{\code{Y.t1}}{integer: mental state assessment in week 1. Coded
  \code{NA} if missing.}
  
  \item{\code{Y.t2}}{integer: mental state assessment in week 2. Coded
  \code{NA} if missing.}
  
  \item{\code{Y.t4}}{integer: mental state assessment in week 4. Coded
  \code{NA} if missing.}
  
  \item{\code{Y.t6}}{integer: mental state assessment in week 6. Coded
  \code{NA} if missing.}
  
  \item{\code{Y.t8}}{integer: mental state assessment in week 8. Coded
  \code{NA} if missing.}
  
  \item{\code{treat}}{integer: treatment allocation. Coded as \code{0 =
  }placebo; \code{1 = }active drug.}
  
  \item{\code{n.obs}}{integer: number of non-missing mental state 
  assessments.}
  
  \item{\code{surv.time}}{numeric: imputed dropout time in weeks. Coded as
  \code{surv.time = 8.002} for completers.}
  
  \item{\code{cens.ind}}{integer: censoring indicator. Coded as \code{0 =
  }completer or non-informative dropout; \code{1 = }potentially informative
  dropout.}

\description{
The data is obtained from a trial in which chronically ill
  mental health patients were randomized across two treatments: placebo and
  an active drug. A questionnaire instrument was used to assess each
  patient's mental state at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 post-randomisation, a
  high recorded score implying a severe condition. Some of the 100 patients
  dropped out of the study for reasons that were thought to be related to
  their mental state, and therefore potentially informative; others dropped
  out for reasons unrelated to their mental state.
