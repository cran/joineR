\title{Empirical variogram for longitudinal data}
\usage{
variogram(indv, time, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{indv}{vector of individual identification, as in the longitudinal data,
repeated for each time point.}

\item{time}{vector of observation time, as in the longitudinal data.}

\item{Y}{vector of observed measurements. This can be a vector of 
longitudinal data, or residuals after fitting a model for the mean
response.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{vargm} and \code{list} with two elements.
  The first \code{svar} is a matrix with columns for all values
  \eqn{(u_ijk,v_ijk)}, and the second \code{sigma2} is the total variability
  in the data.
}
\description{
Calculates the variogram for observed measurements, with two
  components, the total variability in the data, and the variogram for all
  time lags in all individuals.
}
\details{
The empirical variogram in this function is calculated from observed
  half-squared-differences between pairs of measurements, \eqn{v_ijk = 0.5 *
  (r_ij-r_ik)^2} and the corresponding time differences
  \eqn{u_ijk=t_ij-t_ik}. The variogram is plotted for averages of each time
  lag for the \eqn{v_ijk} for all \eqn{i}.
}
\note{
There is a function \code{\link{plot.vargm}} which should be used to 
  plot the empirical variogram.

\examples{
data(mental)
mental.unbalanced <- to.unbalanced(mental, id.col = 1,

                                   Y.col = 2:7, 
                                   other.col = c(8, 10, 11))

vgm <- variogram(indv = tail(mental.unbalanced[, 1], 30),
                 time = tail(mental.unbalanced[, 2], 30),
                 Y = tail(mental.unbalanced[, 3], 30))
